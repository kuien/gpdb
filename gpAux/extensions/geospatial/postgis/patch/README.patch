Usage:
--------
0. Download the source code of PostGIS 2.1.5
  wget http://download.osgeo.org/postgis/source/postgis-2.1.5.tar.gz /tmp/
  cp /tmp/postgis-2.1.5.tar.gz $GPDB/cdb-pg/contrib/postgis/

  NOTE: we are providing the source code of PostGIS, but you can 
	also download it from websites if you insist.

1. Extract and patch the raw PostGIS 2.1.5
  cd $GPDB/cdb-pg/contrib/postgis
  ./build.sh

  NOTE: build.sh will extract the tar ball firstly and then patch it. Again,
	you can patch the package with commands below, e.g., 
		1. patch -p 4 < $GIS/patch/postgis-2.1.5-GPDB.patch
		2. Or perform command below in GIT working directory:
			cd $GPDB/cdb-pg/contrib/postgis/
			git apply $GIS/patch/postgis-2.1.5-GPDB.patch

2. Compile the patched PostGIS 2.1.5
  cd $GPDB/cdb-pg/contrib/postgis/
  make

3. Run regressing tests
  cd $GPDB/cdb-pg/contrib/postgis/
  make check

Note:
--------
Now we can compile PostGIS Geometry and pass all the regressing tests except below:
1. regress_selectivity
  #Greenplum does not support ANALYZE functions for user-defined data types.
2. long_xact
  #Greenplum does not support long transcation for user-defined data types with triggers
3. typmod
  #Greenplum does not support BINARY, so test cannot continues...

Furthermore, we can compile PostGIS Raster and pass all the regressing tests.
Beside, we are enriching GPDB 4.4 with necessary features to support PostGIS Topology.
